# Unix Shell Project (C-Based Unix-like Shell)

**Developed with Diego Dopazo Garcia as our Operating Systems class project**

*Operating Systems Class: Sept 2022 â€“ Dec 2022*

In this repository, you will find the source code for our Unix-like shell project developed as part of our Operating Systems class.

## Project Overview

- **Description**: This project involved the development and implementation of a Unix-like shell in C, encompassing a wide array of system-level functions and commands.
- **Key Skills**: The project serves as a testament to our deep system-level programming skills, underscoring our profound understanding of operating systems and low-level programming.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: We created a user-friendly command-line interface, enabling users to execute essential Unix-like operations effortlessly, emphasizing problem-solving and systems development expertise.

## Features

**Built-in Commands:**

- **hist:** Display command history.
- **comando:** Add, remove, or list user-defined shell commands.
- **fin | bye | salir:** Exit the shell.
- **allocate:** Manage memory allocation using options such as `-malloc`, `-createshared`, `-shared`, and `-mmap`.
- **memory:** Display information about local and global variables, as well as program and library functions.
- **deallocate:** Deallocate memory using options like `-malloc`, `-delkey`, `-shared`, and `-mmap`.
- **showvar:** Display environment variables, their values, and their memory addresses.
- **changevar:** Change environment variables in different ways (-a, -e, -p).
- **showenv:** Display environment variables and their memory addresses.
- **fork:** Create a new process.
- **jobs | listjobs:** List background jobs.
- **job:** Display information about a specific job or bring a background job to the foreground.
- **deljobs:** Clear background jobs, either terminated or signaled.
- **execute:** Execute external programs.

**External Programs:**

You can execute any external programs just like in a regular shell. For example, you can run common commands like `ls`, `cat`, `gcc`, etc.


## Getting Started

To use this project clone it in your device, and run the p3 file like this:
```./p3```
Then you can use the built in commands that are expressed in the Features section.
